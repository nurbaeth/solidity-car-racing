Solidity Car Racing Game 🚗
An onchain car racing game where players compete by sending transactions to move their cars forward.
The first player to reach the finish line wins!

Features ✨
🔹 Join the race before it starts

🔹 Start the race when enough players have joined

🔹 Move forward by sending a transaction

🔹 The first player to reach the finish line wins

How It Works ⚙️
Players call joinRace() to register.

Once enough players have joined, any player can call startRace().
